# Colorado Mountain Flying

This repository is for pilots who love (or need to) fly through the challenging terrain of the Colorado Rockies. It provides essential waypoints for key mountain passes, helping you plan safe VFR routes, maintain terrain clearance, and navigate high-altitude environments.

Many pilots use ForeFlight as their electronic flight bag (EFB) [ForeFlight](https://www.foreflight.com/) app, which contains a feature to download and import custom *content packs* that contain bundles of related content that can be accessed in the app, making it easier to adapt ForeFlight to a variety of specialized uses. See [ForeFlight Content Pack Overview](https://www.foreflight.com/products/foreflight-mobile/user-content/content-packs) and [ForeFlight Content Pack Support](https://foreflight.com/support/content-packs/) for more details.

# Colorado Mountain Flying Content

This repository maintains a directory of Colorado mountain passes as VFR GPS waypoints, viewable as a custom map layer on the ForeFlight Maps page. This allows you to visualize passes, plan routes with proper altitude margins, and integrate them with terrain awareness tools like the Hazard Advisor.

The content pack includes waypoints for 19 key mountain passes, developed in collaboration with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Colorado Pilots Association (CPA). These waypoints enable safe crossing with recommended 1,000 ft+ clearance (2,000 ft+ in winds >20 kts).

As an example, this is how the mountain passes appear overlaid on the Colorado terrain map once the content pack is imported and activated:

*(Imagine a screenshot here showing waypoints like VPROL over Rollins Pass on a sectional chart view.)*
