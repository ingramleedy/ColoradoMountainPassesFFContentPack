# Colorado Mountain Flying Content Pack for ForeFlight

This repository provides a **ForeFlight content pack** containing custom VFR GPS waypoints and a map layer for key mountain passes in Colorado. These waypoints and overlays help pilots safely navigate the challenging Rocky Mountain terrain by providing clear crossing points, recommended altitude margins, and enhanced situational awareness.

The content pack displays passes as a custom map layer in ForeFlight, integrating seamlessly with terrain, hazard advisor, profile view, and sectional charts for better route planning.

## Content Overview

This content pack includes VFR waypoints for numerous Colorado mountain passes, drawn from the **Colorado Pilots Association (CPA)** comprehensive training materials and expanded to cover commonly flown routes. It includes both official CDOT/FAA-charted waypoints (added to sectionals in 2024 and available natively in ForeFlight) and additional user waypoints for passes frequently referenced in mountain flying education.

**Current version: 2025.12.11**  
**Number of passes: 36**

Many official waypoints (e.g., for 10-20 key passes) are now integrated directly into ForeFlight via FAA updates. This custom pack supplements those with additional passes, detailed notes, and a dedicated overlay layer for quick reference.

### Enhanced Usage with ForeFlight Hazard Advisor

For optimal safety in mountain flying, use this content pack in conjunction with ForeFlight's **Hazard Advisor** feature. Hazard Advisor overlays color-coded terrain and obstacle alerts (red for within 100' of your altitude, yellow for within 1,000') on the map, helping you visualize clearance margins when planning routes over these passes. It also integrates with Profile View for a vertical cross-section of hazards along your flight path.

- **Activation:** Enable Hazard Advisor in Map Settings > Layers > Hazard Advisor. Set your Hazard Altitude to match your planned crossing altitude (e.g., 1,000–2,000' above pass elevation).
- **In-Flight Mode:** When airborne and GPS speed exceeds the activation threshold (default 60 kts), it auto-adjusts to your current altitude for real-time alerts.
- **Subscription Note:** Hazard Advisor requires a ForeFlight **Essential** subscription or higher. For advanced options like custom hazard altitudes, consider Pro Plus or Performance plans.

This combination allows you to cross-reference pass waypoints with dynamic hazard shading, ensuring you maintain safe margins in variable winds and terrain.

*Fly safe: Always cross passes at a 45° angle when possible, attain maximum altitude before crossing, monitor for downdrafts/turbulence (especially in winds >20 kts), and plan escape routes. Strongly recommend completing CPA mountain flying training.*

## Importing the Content Pack into ForeFlight

Detailed instructions: [ForeFlight Content Packs Support](https://www.foreflight.com/support/content-packs/).

1. Download the ZIP file from the repository (link below).
2. On iOS/iPadOS: Open in Safari → Downloads → Share → ForeFlight.
3. ForeFlight will unpack and install the pack.
4. Restart ForeFlight.
5. On Maps view, select layer: Aero & Category → "CO Mtn Routes" on left and "CO Mountain Passes" on right.

**Download:** [ColoradoMountainPassesFFContentPack.zip](https://github.com/ingramleedy/ColoradoMountainPassesFFContentPack/blob/main/ColoradoMountainPassesFFContentPack.zip?raw=true) 
Note: Content packs require manual re-download for updates. Official CDOT waypoints update automatically via ForeFlight database downloads.

Contributions welcome: Add missing coordinates, update notes, or improve the layer!



## Addendum: Syncing Content Packs via Cloud Storage (e.g., OneDrive)

For users who want to easily manage and sync the Colorado Mountain Passes content pack across multiple devices, you can integrate a cloud storage service like Microsoft OneDrive with ForeFlight. This setup allows you to host the content pack .zip file in a shared folder, where it can automatically sync across your devices via OneDrive. Once integrated, new or updated .zip files placed in the designated folder will appear in ForeFlight's More > Downloads section for import. With ForeFlight's Automatic Content Packs Download setting (enabled by default in recent versions), packs can download automatically, and updates (e.g., replacing the .zip with a newer version) can be handled by re-importing the revised file.

**Note:** This feature requires a ForeFlight Pro or higher subscription plan for Cloud Documents integration. Content packs do not auto-update in-place; you must replace the .zip file with an updated version (ideally including a version number in the optional manifest.json for tracking) and re-import it. However, the cloud sync ensures the latest .zip is available on all linked devices.

### Steps to Integrate OneDrive with ForeFlight

1. **Sign in to ForeFlight Web:** Go to [plan.foreflight.com](https://plan.foreflight.com) and log in with your ForeFlight account (as an administrator if using a multi-pilot account).

2. **Navigate to Documents:** In the sidebar, click on **Documents**.

3. **Add a Cloud Drive:** In the **My Drives** section, click **Add a Cloud Drive**.

4. **Select OneDrive:** From the **Drive Provider** dropdown menu, choose **OneDrive** (supports OneDrive Personal, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint Online).

5. **Configure the Drive:**
   - Enter a **Drive Name** (e.g., "My OneDrive").
   - Specify the name of an **existing folder** in your OneDrive root level (e.g., "ForeFlightDocs"). If it doesn't exist, create it first in your OneDrive account via the web or app.

6. **Connect and Authorize:** Click **Add Drive**, then sign in with your Microsoft credentials and grant ForeFlight access to the folder.

7. **Verify Integration:** After connecting, the specified OneDrive folder will be linked for hosting documents and content packs. Files added here will sync to ForeFlight.

### Setting Up the "contentpack" Folder for Automatic Sync

1. **Create the Folder:** In your linked OneDrive folder (e.g., "/ForeFlightDocs/"), create a subfolder named exactly **contentpack** (case-sensitive). This is the designated location for content pack .zip files.
   - Full path example: If your linked folder is "ForeFlightDocs", the path would be `/ForeFlightDocs/contentpack/`.

2. **Place the .zip File:** Download the latest `ColoradoMountainPassesFFContentPack.zip` from this repository and upload it to the `contentpack` folder in OneDrive. The file will automatically sync across all your devices connected to OneDrive.

3. **Access in ForeFlight:**
   - Open ForeFlight on your iOS/iPadOS device.
   - Go to **More > Downloads**.
   - The content pack should appear automatically under available downloads (thanks to Cloud Documents integration).
   - If Automatic Content Packs Download is enabled (check in ForeFlight Web: Account > Integrations > Cloud Documents), it will download without manual selection.
   - Import the pack as described in the "Importing the Content Pack into ForeFlight" section above.

4. **Handling Updates:**
   - When a new version of the content pack is released (e.g., updated waypoints or notes), download the new .zip and replace the old one in your OneDrive `/contentpack/` folder.
   - OneDrive will sync the updated file across devices.
   - In ForeFlight, the new version will appear in More > Downloads; import it to apply the update (older versions may show expiration warnings if dates are set in the manifest).

This setup ensures your content pack is always accessible and up-to-date across devices without manual transfers. For more details, refer to ForeFlight's [OneDrive Integration Support](https://support.foreflight.com/hc/en-us/articles/14443946235671-How-can-OneDrive-be-integrated-with-ForeFlight) and [Content Packs Support](https://foreflight.com/support/content-packs/). If using Dropbox instead, the process is similar, with the folder at `~/Dropbox/Apps/ForeFlight/contentpack/`.
