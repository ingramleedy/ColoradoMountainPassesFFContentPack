# Colorado Mountain Flying Content Pack for ForeFlight

This repository provides a **ForeFlight content pack** containing custom VFR GPS waypoints and a map layer for key mountain passes in Colorado. These waypoints and overlays help pilots safely navigate the challenging Rocky Mountain terrain by providing clear crossing points, recommended altitude margins, and enhanced situational awareness.

The content pack displays passes as a custom map layer in ForeFlight, integrating seamlessly with terrain, hazard advisor, profile view, and sectional charts for better route planning.

## Content Overview

This content pack includes VFR waypoints for numerous Colorado mountain passes, drawn from the **Colorado Pilots Association (CPA)** comprehensive training materials and expanded to cover commonly flown routes. It includes both official CDOT/FAA-charted waypoints (added to sectionals in 2024 and available natively in ForeFlight) and additional user waypoints for passes frequently referenced in mountain flying education.

**Current version: 2025.12.11**  
**Number of passes: 50+**

Many official waypoints (e.g., for 10-20 key passes) are now integrated directly into ForeFlight via FAA updates. This custom pack supplements those with additional passes, detailed notes, and a dedicated overlay layer for quick reference.
